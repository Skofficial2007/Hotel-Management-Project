# Hotel Management Project

Welcome to the Hotel Management Project! This is a simple C++ project that demonstrates object-oriented programming features to manage hotel and restaurant operations. In this project, we've developed a system that allows customers to choose between staying at the hotel for a couple of days or dining at the restaurant connected to the hotel.

## Features

### Hotel Stay
If a customer decides to stay at the hotel, they can perform the following actions:

1. **Check-In**: The customer can input the number of days they want to stay and select a room of their choice. Additionally, they have the option to request room service during their stay.

2. **Room Service**: Customers can choose whether they want room service or not. Any food ordered through room service will be included in the final bill.

3. **Check-Out**: When the customer checks out, the system calculates the overall bill. If room service was used, the bill for food will be included along with the room charges.

### Restaurant Service
For customers who only wish to dine at the restaurant, the following options are available:

1. **Menu Selection**: Customers can browse the restaurant's menu and select items they want to order. They can choose from a variety of menu items.

2. **Add Item to Order**: Customers can add items to their order by providing the menu item number and the desired quantity.

3. **Show Order**: This option displays the number of items ordered so far.

4. **Check Out**: Upon choosing this option, the system generates the final bill for the items ordered from the restaurant.
